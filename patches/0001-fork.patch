+	// FORK: The Fastly provider takes advantage of TF's behavior in a somewhat novel way that causes a bug when the
+	// same provider is bridged in Pulumi. Therefore, we need to add the following block of code to ensure consistent
+	// behavior in the bridged provider.
+	//
+	// Detailed explanation:
+	//
+	// The TF provider interface looks like this:
+	//   Plan(prior state, config) -> planned state
+	//   Apply(prior state, planned state, config) -> new state
+	//
+	// In the Plan() stage, diffs include any CustomizeDiff funcs in the schema. However, Terraform's behavior (at
+	// least after v2.10.1 of the plugin SDK) is to strip diff customizers when performing an Apply.
+	//
+	// The Pulumi interface looks like this:
+	//   Diff(prior state, config) -> diff result
+	//   Update(prior state, config) -> new state
+	//
+	// In both cases, Pulumi does not strip diff customizers.
+	//
+	// For this resource, the effect of the difference in behavior is that during a call to Apply, the cloned_version
+	// attribute is not treated as computed, even though in the Plan it is treated as computed. This difference is
+	// because the cloned_version attribute is marked as computed by CustomizeDiff, which Pulumi runs during Update but
+	// TF does not run during Apply. The Pulumi provider reads the cloned_version field in its implementation of Update
+	// for that resource, so in TF it gets back the last actual value, but with Pulumi it gets back the zero value (0)
