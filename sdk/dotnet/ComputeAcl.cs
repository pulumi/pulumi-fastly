{
    /// <summary>
    /// Provides a Compute Access Control List (ACL) that defines CIDR-based access rules (e.g., allow/block IP ranges) and is accessible to Compute services during request processing.
    /// 
    /// In order for a Compute ACL (`fastly.ComputeAcl`) to be accessible to a [Compute](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute/) service you'll first need to define a Compute service (`fastly.ServiceCompute`) in your configuration, and then create a link to the ACL from within the service using the `ResourceLink` block (shown in the below examples).
    /// 
    /// ## Example Usage
    /// 
    /// Basic usage:
    /// 
    /// ```csharp
    /// using System.Collections.Generic;
    /// using System.Linq;
    /// using Pulumi;
    /// using Fastly = Pulumi.Fastly;
    /// 
    /// return await Deployment.RunAsync(() =&gt; 
    /// {
    ///     // IMPORTANT: Deleting a Compute ACL requires first deleting its resource_link.
    ///     // This requires a two-step `pulumi up` because we can't guarantee deletion order.
    ///     var exampleComputeAcl = new Fastly.ComputeAcl("example", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Name = "my_compute_acl",
    ///     });
    /// 
    ///     var example = Fastly.GetPackageHash.Invoke(new()
    ///     {
    ///         Filename = "package.tar.gz",
    ///     });
    /// 
    ///     var exampleServiceCompute = new Fastly.ServiceCompute("example", new()
    ///     {
    ///         Name = "my_compute_service",
    ///         Domains = new[]
    ///         {
    ///             new Fastly.Inputs.ServiceComputeDomainArgs
    ///             {
    ///                 Name = "demo.example.com",
    ///             },
    ///         },
    ///         Package = new Fastly.Inputs.ServiceComputePackageArgs
    ///         {
    ///             Filename = "package.tar.gz",
    ///             SourceCodeHash = example.Apply(getPackageHashResult =&gt; getPackageHashResult.Hash),
    ///         },
    ///         ResourceLinks = new[]
    ///         {
    ///             new Fastly.Inputs.ServiceComputeResourceLinkArgs
    ///             {
    ///                 Name = "my_acl_link",
    ///                 ResourceId = exampleComputeAcl.Id,
    ///             },
    ///         },
    ///         ForceDestroy = true,
    ///     });
    /// 
    /// });
    /// ```
    /// 
    /// ## Import
    /// 
    /// Fastly Compute ACLs can be imported using their ACL ID, e.g.
    /// 
    /// ```sh
    /// $ pulumi import fastly:index/computeAcl:ComputeAcl example &lt;compute_acl_id&gt;
    /// ```
