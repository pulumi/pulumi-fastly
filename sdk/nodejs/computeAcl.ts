/**
 * Provides a Compute Access Control List (ACL) that defines CIDR-based access rules (e.g., allow/block IP ranges) and is accessible to Compute services during request processing.
 *
 * In order for a Compute ACL (`fastly.ComputeAcl`) to be accessible to a [Compute](https://developer.fastly.com/learning/compute/) service you'll first need to define a Compute service (`fastly.ServiceCompute`) in your configuration, and then create a link to the ACL from within the service using the `resourceLink` block (shown in the below examples).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Basic usage:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as fastly from "@pulumi/fastly";
 *
 * // IMPORTANT: Deleting a Compute ACL requires first deleting its resource_link.
 * // This requires a two-step `pulumi up` because we can't guarantee deletion order.
 * const exampleComputeAcl = new fastly.ComputeAcl("example", {name: "my_compute_acl"});
 * const example = fastly.getPackageHash({
 *     filename: "package.tar.gz",
 * });
 * const exampleServiceCompute = new fastly.ServiceCompute("example", {
 *     name: "my_compute_service",
 *     domains: [{
 *         name: "demo.example.com",
 *     }],
 *     "package": {
 *         filename: "package.tar.gz",
 *         sourceCodeHash: example.then(example => example.hash),
 *     },
 *     resourceLinks: [{
 *         name: "my_acl_link",
 *         resourceId: exampleComputeAcl.id,
 *     }],
 *     forceDestroy: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Fastly Compute ACLs can be imported using their ACL ID, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import fastly:index/computeAcl:ComputeAcl example <compute_acl_id>
 * ```
