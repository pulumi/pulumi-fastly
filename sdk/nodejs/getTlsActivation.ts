/**
 * Use this data source to get information on a TLS activation, including the certificate used, and the domain on which TLS was enabled.
 *
 * > **Warning:** The data source's filters are applied using an **AND** boolean operator, so depending on the combination
 * of filters, they may become mutually exclusive. The exception to this is `id` which must not be specified in combination
 * with any of the others.
 *
 * > **Note:** If more or less than a single match is returned by the search, this provider will fail. Ensure that your search is specific enough to return a single key.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as fastly from "@pulumi/fastly";
 *
 * const example = pulumi.output(fastly.getTlsActivation({
 *     domain: "example.com",
 * }));
 * ```
